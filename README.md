### SPR_OS

**Description**: A simple operating system project aimed at understanding how operating systems work during my free time. The majority of the code is sourced from various online resources, including:

- **[OSDev Wiki: Expanded Main Page](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page)**
- **[OSDever Tutorials](http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/)**
- Numerous videos and forum posts.

This operating system is basically a **Frankenstein** of code collected from various online resources.

**Requirements**:  
To run SPR_OS, you need to set up an x86 cross-compiler and have the /i686-elf/bin directory added to path. A quick guide can be found in this **[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpFUzjYehxs)**. Additionally, you must have **NASM** and **QEMU** installed.
