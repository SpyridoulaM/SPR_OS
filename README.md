# SPR_OS

**Overview**  
SPR_OS is a project where I'm teaching myself the basics of operating system development. It's a bit of a **Frankenstein OS**â€”pieced together from various online tutorials and resources. Below are some of the key references that helped me along the way:

### Resources

## Requirements

To build **SPR_OS**, you'll need:

- An **x86 cross-compiler** (you can follow [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpFUzjYehxs) to set it up)
- **NASM** (assembler)
- **QEMU** (emulator)

Make sure the `/i686-elf/bin` directory is in your `PATH`.

## Running SPR_OS

To run the `SPR_OS.iso`, you'll need **QEMU**. Then, run the following command:

```bash
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom SPR_OS.iso
