# SPR_OS
**Description:**

A simple operating system project aimed at understanding how operating systems work during my free time. The majority of the code is sourced from various online resources, including:

    OSDev Wiki: Expanded Main Page
    OSDever Tutorials
    Numerous videos and forum posts.

This operating system is essentially a "Frankenstein" of code collected from different online materials.

**Requirements:**

To run SPR_OS, you need to set up an x86 cross-compiler. A quick guide can be found in this YouTube video. Additionally, you must have NASM and QEMU installed.
