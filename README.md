### SPR_OS

**Description**:  
This is a fun little project where I'm learning how operating systems work in my free time. Most of the code here is pieced together from various online resources, so it's a bit of a **Frankenstein OS**. Some of the main resources I've used include:

- **[OSDev Wiki: Expanded Main Page](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page)**
- **[OSDever Tutorials](http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/)**
- Countless YouTube videos, tutorials, and forum posts.

If you're curious about the video materials that helped me along the way, check out these playlists:
- **[x86 Operating System Programming](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2EF13wm-hWAglI8rRbdsCPq_wRpYvQQy&si=eB_u-xFsZNFLyHfk)**  
- **[Creating a Kernel from Scratch](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFjM7v6KGMpiH2G-kT781ByCNC_0pKpPN&si=jyIQcacAIsRcEEDQ)**  
- **[OS Development Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3B56ql_akNcvH8vvJRYOc7TbYhRs19M&si=oSKIqGKkr7AHFJzV)**  

**Requirements**:  
To run **SPR_OS**, you'll need to set up an x86 cross-compiler and make sure the `/i686-elf/bin` directory is in your PATH. There's a great step-by-step guide in this **[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpFUzjYehxs)** that helped me get started. You'll also need **NASM** and **QEMU** installed to test everything out.
